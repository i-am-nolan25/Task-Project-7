# Project 7 - *Task Management*

Submitted by: **Nolan Lwin**

In this project, I updated an existing Task app with the ability to save and persist task data to local storage using UserDefaults. In addition I added tab bar navigation so users can manage their tasks on the main tasks list as well as a calendar.
